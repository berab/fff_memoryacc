# Acceleration on conditional NNs via memory caching

This repository contains specific branches for different targets and workflows:

1. torch — Training and exporting trained models (including exporting to C) and collecting model statistics used for memory-acceleration research and workflows.
2. apollo4l — C implementation for benchmarking and running on the Apollo4 Blue Lite platform.
3. cpu — C implementation targeting general-purpose processors (Intel, AMD, arm64).

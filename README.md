# Acceleration on conditional NNs via memory caching

This repository contains specific branches for different targets and workflows:

- [torch](https://github.com/berab/fff_memoryacc/tree/torch) — Training and exporting trained models (including exporting to C) and collecting model statistics used for memory-acceleration research and workflows.
- [apollo4l](https://github.com/berab/fff_memoryacc/tree/apollo4l) — C implementation for benchmarking and running on the Apollo4 Blue Lite platform.
- [cpu](https://github.com/berab/fff_memoryacc/tree/cpu) — C implementation targeting general-purpose processors (Intel, AMD, arm64).
